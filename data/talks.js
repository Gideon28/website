            "abstract": "A backend-for-frontend is a service specifically built to be consumed by a frontend application. General purpose backends are typically built alongside clients for their needs. As more clients with more features need access, your originally focussed backend can become more monolithic in size and design. One way to avoid this runaway design is to introduce a backend for each client with only relevant features. I'll show you how to produce a backend-for-frontend Express application that hosts it's own React client, so the entire stack can be built and deployed together.",

We're not going to make a dummy application that's perfectly tailored for use with a PWA, then show you just how easy it is to turn it into one. We're not going to talk about how much faster, or how much more useful our website is now that it's a PWA. We're not even going to make anything particularly useful.

I'm going to show you how to use the concept of "the boring solution" to make small changes to a big application. Small changes that, over time, turn in to large ones. Specifically, my process of turning GitLab into a "PWA" in less than 100 lines of code.

This is a real story of GitLab's journey to a fully fledged PWA. One small step at a time.`,

In this talk, I’ll show that our code doesn’t just have to be for building boring applications. Using real examples, I’ll talk about some ways that we can bring creativity into our coding projects, as well as ways for us to share our knowledge and why it’s important that we do. By the end, I hope to have inspired you to bring creativity into your projects and given you the enthusiasm to share your knowledge.`,

However developing for these is still a very vague and improvised strategy, with tools and frameworks only offering a limited scope and most of us as web developers unaware on the layers of compexity involved in creating an effective AI.

Join me for what I believe is a solution to this problem, aimed at simplifying and consolidating the code needed in an nice and easy to use package/ecosystem.`,
